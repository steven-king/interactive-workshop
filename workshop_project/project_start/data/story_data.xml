<text><![CDATA[<p>When the economic crisis erupted in 2008, many Europeans assumed they were facing a couple of bad years. But the crisis, now in its fifth year, seems to go on and on, using up unemployment benefits, eating through savings accounts and dashing dreams of an easy retirement</p>.
<p>Over the past year, the countries hit hardest by the crisis — Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland — have struggled to bring down their debts. They have raised taxes, laid off workers, reduced services and have begun charging for medical care that had been free for decades. Each country had its own formula. But they were joined in the misery of trying to make do on less — and then even less.</p>
<p>No amount of cutting seemed to be enough. Businesses continued to fail at a rapid pace. Even many of those Europeans who thought they were safe lost their jobs. Those who had work saw their salaries reduced. Parents watched their children fly off to other countries looking for employment — or welcomed them back into their childhood rooms because they were losing their homes to foreclosure.</p>]]></text>
